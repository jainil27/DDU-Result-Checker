# DDU-Result-Checker
Command line utility to auto navigate to results, and search particular student result for IT sem 6, 2019 Batch.

Run the .py file and enter the name of the student, a browser instance will be started which will ask you for the captcha, and redirect you directly to the results of 6th sem external.

PreRequisites : ChromeWebdriver is required for this purpose, keep it anywhere in your drive and enter its path in the .py file.

The program searches student name from an excel sheet, and fetches Id and Date of Birth from the same, i have also provided a excel file, which contains only my entry but you know where to get it from. :)

Also the results have been mapped to external sem 6, but you can change it by replacing yt10 to yt11 or anything you need.
